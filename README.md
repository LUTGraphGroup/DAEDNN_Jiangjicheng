DAEDNN: Deep Neural Network Model for Inferring MiRNA-Disease Association Based on Attention Mechanism Denoising Autoencoder

1. HMDD 3.2 is the dataset for this experiment. The release file contains data for calculating semantic similarity of diseases, the miRNA file contains data and code for obtaining sequence similarity and functional similarity, and the gene release file contains similarity data and code for disease feature vectors obtained through the association between diseases and genes.
2. The HMDD 2.0 and miR2release files contain their respective integrated similarity data and experimental code for conducting pan Chinese experiments on multiple datasets.
3. The data.rar compressed package file contains the final dataset after integrating multiple similarities of HMDD 3.2.
4. main.py represents running experimental files.
5. Running main.py requires the following environment and dependency packages:
biopython 1.78
keras 2.3.1
matplotlib 3.5.3
numpy 1.21.6
openpyxl 3.0.10
pandas 1.3.5
python 3.7.0
scikit-learn 1.0.2
